# Jupyter notebooks covering python basics
### These are all in early rough draft state... Will update and add more notebooks when time allows 
Most of this code is my own, but a lot of the topics covered are heavily influenced from the following people's work... Definitely check them out.    
* David Beazley
* Raymond Hettinger
* Ned Batchelder 
* Fabrizio Romano
